The app generates and displays math problems that are drawn from a collection of over 80 different skills. The user can choose which skills they'd like to practice on. Each skill is customizable and has its own settings that the user can adjust. Multiple skills can be combined in order to shuffle different question types together.

Some skills support "stacked mode" where, instead of being generated completely randomly, a pool of questions for that skill are created, and every question from that pool must be answered correctly once before any question is seen again. This is analogous to shuffling a deck of cards, dealing them out, then, only once they're all dealt, combining and reshuffing them to be dealt again. Stacked mode allows, for example, a user to practice their times tables up to 12 while ensuring that they cover all possible products.
